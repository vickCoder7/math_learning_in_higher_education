# Math Learning in Higher Education
Conducted an analysis of factors affecting studentsâ€™ performance in higher education mathematics. Performed a comparative study of ensemble learning methods and neural networks for performance prediction, achieving over 70% accuracy using ensemble models such as Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.

## Project Overview

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks that:

- **Analyze student data** to identify factors influencing math learning outcomes.
- **Build and evaluate machine learning models** to predict student performance.
- **Visualize key insights** from the data.

## Notebooks

### project.ipynb

- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Investigates correlations between features and student outcomes.
- Summarizes key insights and recommendations for improving math learning.

### models.ipynb

- Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
- Explores feature engineering and selection.
- Implements various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests).
- Developed a neural network (performed poorly)
- Evaluates models using metrics such as f1 score, AUC-ROC
- Compares model performance and discusses findings.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter and run the cells.

## Data

The project uses anonymized student data relevant to math courses in higher education, sourced from MathE platform. Data preprocessing steps are included in the notebooks.
